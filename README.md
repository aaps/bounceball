# bounceball
a fork of legume's bounceball game, as example of python legume code, and as entertainment for tkkrlab 

A readme it is the law or something.

it needs pygame and legume, best installed via pip

this will be the example code that will be used to make stardog have multiplayer.

perhaps there will be a starpup first.

I guess some people at tkkrlab like it as well.
